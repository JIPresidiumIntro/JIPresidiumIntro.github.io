            <p class="lead intro"> "With the heart of a fierce tiger and the ability to appreciate the delicate scent of a rose, I possess both a passionate drive and a keen eye for detail. In areas such as rights advocacy, cultural initiatives, and events, I bring my unique ideas to the table. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> In just two semesters, I have been involved in various student organizations, including the Student Council, Youth Volunteer Team, Interview Group, Science Association, and the Buddy Program. Throughout these experiences, I have continuously explored and sought the flickering light within my heart. Becoming an innovator of activities, an advocate for student rights, and a contributor to student organizations have become the driving forces behind my passion. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> When it comes to activity innovation, I excel at finding entry points and focusing on the unique characteristics of our college, such as internationalization. Within the college community, I strive to facilitate vibrant events that promote cross-cultural communication and foster a more inclusive and diverse environment. I actively communicate and seek collaborations, leveraging relevant resources to transform ideas into reality.</p>
            <p class="lead intro"> Regarding student rights, I am attentive to the needs expressed by individuals around me. I also pay close attention to areas where improvements can be made in my own academic and personal life. I am committed to narrowing the "information gap" and establishing more timely and convenient channels for expressing opinions and receiving feedback. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> Furthermore, I prioritize the long-term development of the Student Council, aiming to enhance its cohesion and influence. I actively contribute ideas for interdepartmental cooperation, fostering communication, coordination, and mutual growth among departments. My goal is to propel the JI Student Council to stand out among the various student organizations in our college, building upon its current foundation and establishing a distinctive identity.</p>

            <p class="lead intro">“心有猛虎，细嗅蔷薇。”我既拥有饱满的热情与大胆的想法，也能够在细心观察中“独具慧眼“，在权益、文化、活动等方面都富有自己独特的idea。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 短短两个学期中，我参与了学生会、青志队、访谈组、科协以及Buddy Program，在尝试的过程中不断探索，不断寻觅心中的微光。做一名活动的创新者、学生权益的发声者、学生组织的贡献者，这些想法逐渐成为了我的热情所在。</p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 在活动创新方面，我善于寻找切入点，聚焦学院独有的特色，如internationalization等，在学院内部力争通过更为精彩的活动促进来自不同文化背景的人们相互交流，塑造更为包容多元的环境。并且我积极沟通，主动寻找合作，能够有效借助相关资源，将想法更好地变为现实。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 学生权益上，我是一名生活中的有心人，经常会留意身边听到的诉求，也留意自己在学习、生活中需要改进的地方，并且我也致力于缩小“信息差“，建设更及时方便的意见提出、反馈途径。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 此外，我也注重学生会的长远发展，提升学生会的凝聚力和号召力。积极为跨部门合作提出想法，促进部门之间的沟通协调与共同发展。我希望能够推动密院学生会，使其在现在的基础上更有特色，在众多学院的学生组织中脱颖而出。 </p>

            <h2>Xu Yifei</h2>
    <h3>July 2023</h3>

    <h4>Campaign Philosophy: Enjoy the work together~</h4>
    <h4>Campaign Platform: Pursue Media-driven Development, Create a New Model that Combines Team, Work, and Play.</h4>

    <h5>Platform Explanation:</h5>
    <p>
        Currently, some members of the student onion are under excessive work pressure, while others rarely participate in student union activities. Initially, we joined the student union because of our passion, but gradually, the sense of enjoyment seems to be diminishing. The reason for this may be inadequate team building. Therefore, I aim to integrate teamwork, work, and play as the overall reform goals.
    </p>

    <h3>I. About Deepening the Construction and Reform of the Student Union Organization</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Positioning of the Student union</h4>
            <p>
                In summary, the student union is a platform established by students, serving students, following school leadership, and safeguarding student rights. Essentially, the student union is like a "bridge" that connects students with teachers and with each other. Therefore, the student union is a service-oriented organization whose main business is to serve students.
                The reform direction of a service-oriented organization can be considered from two aspects: enhancing publicity effectiveness and improving service quality. Therefore, the reform of the media department will be one of the key aspects of my reform plan. In the era of social media, publicity is a crucial task for any organization, especially for a service-oriented organization like the student union. However, the current publicity work needs improvement.
                Considering the importance of the media department, I hope to drive the overall reform of the student union by reforming the media department, thereby enhancing work efficiency and the role of the student union.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Reform Plan for a New Media Model: Comprehensive Reform of the Media Department</h4>
            <p>
                To align with the positioning of the student union, the media department needs certain functional adjustments.
                Currently, the media department consists of the design group, subscription group, and photography group. It appears that the relative emptiness of content is a common problem in the media department. Based on this, I propose the following reform plan:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Revision of the functions of the Subscription group</h5>
                    <p>
                        I suggest clarifying the mode of cooperation for WeChat Account subscription: other departments independently complete content writing and basic formatting, and then submit it to the subscription group for secondary formatting. The purpose of secondary formatting is to give different sections different promotional styles, including color schemes, fonts, and layout patterns, through collaboration within the media department.
                        In addition, during periods when subscriptions are not active, the group can engage in in-depth formatting design learning and create a library of templates and resources for other departments to use.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Expansion of the functions of the photography group</h5>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the photography group can write their own reports as event photographers, complementing the official summaries of other departments. The style of their work will focus on capturing highlights, on-the-spot moments, voting games, interactive challenges, and interviews. The goal is to pay attention to feedback from event participants and establish a two-way feedback channel. (Further discussion on the rights and interests aspect)
                        Additionally, the photography group can start creating "JI Album," a long-term project that includes high-quality images, such as large-scale photos of the campus. This project can incorporate diverse forms, such as photography submissions. In the new year, we can organize artistic photography sessions with a limited number of participants for specific types of photo shoots and editing work.

                    <h5>Transformation of the design group into the graphic design group</h5>
                    <p>
                        The original functions of the "design group" will be taken over and retained.
                        In addition, it will primarily be responsible for the continuous production of "JI Imagination" and related graphic design work. (Further discussion on the Institute's culture aspect)

            <h4>Reform of the Student union's Organizational Structure: Working Groups (Liaison Department's Outer Group as a Pilot)</h4>
            <p>
                Reform Goal: A new model that combines teamwork, work, and play. Currently, some students face excessive work pressure, which may be due to inadequate team building, leading to a lack of enjoyment. Therefore, I aim to integrate teamwork, work, and play as the overall reform goal.
                Currently, most activities are organized by voluntary participation, resulting in uneven distribution of workload and some students not contributing. I propose the implementation of working groups, with the group as the smallest unit of structure. Activity planning will be carried out by designated working groups, replacing voluntary participation. This approach will facilitate closer communication within the group, driving overall interaction and communication within the department.
                To address the issue of lack of motivation among students, efforts will be made to include student union activities in the school's labor hour system.

            <h4>Technical Department: Enhancing Activity Promotion Effects</h4>
            <p>
                The activities of the technical department have their unique characteristics. I acknowledge the current philosophy of organizing activities: "Let all participants leave with gains." However, the problem is that some students are not even aware of the activities organized by the technical department. Therefore, I believe there should be an emphasis on enhancing promotional efforts.
                One possible obstacle is that the content may seem dull. Therefore, images or simple edited videos can be included in the promotions to make the technical achievements more visually appealing. Additionally, the use of past event reviews in the form of videos can attract the audience's attention.
                Furthermore, the technical department can explore other types of technical work beyond programming, such as assembly and construction techniques taught in the engineering course.

            <h4>Other Departments</h4>
            <p>
                As a pilot department for "interactive media," further discussion is needed for the Art Department. The Inner Group of the Liaison Department will be discussed in the "rights and interests" section. The Career Department, Outer Group of the Liaison Department, and Sport and Club Department will be discussed in the section on "communication between the student union and school-level and college-level student organizations."

    <h3>II. College Culture and Activities</h3>
    <h3>1. Ji Album</h3>
  <p>The Ji Album is a long-term project that aims to capture the essence and spirit of the college through high-quality images. It will include large-scale photos of the campus, photography submissions, and artistic photography sessions. The project will create a library of visual resources that showcase the beauty and vibrancy of our college community.</p>
  <h2>II. "JI Imagination" Production</h2>
<p>The editing work for "JI Imagination" has already begun at the beginning of the service month, and the first issue has been released. In terms of content, it focuses more on the college scope and students themselves. "JI Imagination" currently consists of four content sections: "Reflection," "Snapshot," "Roaming," and "Bubbles." We aim to provide retrospectives and summaries of activities from a real and firsthand perspective. Additionally, we are committed to collecting beautiful moments from students' lives at JI. Among them, the "Roaming" section mainly includes literary works created by students, which can be compiled and reviewed as a special edition of "JI Imagination" once accumulated. The current structure and operation of "JI Imagination" allow for broad content coverage and ample room for future development.</p>

<h3>III. Safeguarding Student Rights and Feedback</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rights Work Monthly Report (Corresponding to the Liaison Department's Inner Group)</p>
    <p>The nature of traditional rights work is relatively unique. The inner group of the student union serves as a bridge, responsible for conveying students' needs to teachers and school leaders, and to some extent, supervising the execution by teachers and leaders. In this relationship, students are the clients we serve.</p>
    <p>The work goal is not to solve one or a few specific problems but to ensure the existence of a channel for problem resolution. Relying solely on "meetings with the dean" is not enough; therefore, regular feedback to students, in the form of a rights work monthly report or multi-party meetings, is necessary.</p>
    <p>Additionally, students' understanding of the resources provided by the school is also an important aspect of rights work. Therefore, during the service month, an activity called "Resource Organization" was conducted, where I was responsible for organizing the methods of accessing files in the Jiao Tong Library and organizing resources at the Student Innovation Center.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the student union's own rights work: "Interactive Media" (to be piloted in some major events)</p>
    <p>The "interactive media" approach aims to achieve two-way feedback. The classic example of this existing mechanism is the President's Mailbox, where students can directly provide feedback to the school president. This model can be used to assess the quality of student union activities, as feedback from participants is the best way to evaluate them. High-quality event participants can provide direct feedback, for example, many students share posts about the Spring Dance on social media. However, achieving in-depth and extensive "interactive" feedback requires official planning and implementation.</p>
    <p>Based on this, I propose two approaches:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The photography group of the media department can conduct on-site coverage, voting games, interactive challenges, interviews, and other forms to directly obtain feedback from event participants and capture authentic moments of the event.</li>
      <li>Incorporate more video elements into promotions.</li>
      <li>Modify the format of ministerial meetings and invite selected members and event participants as guest speakers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>IV. Communication Between the Student union and School-Level/College-Level Student Organizations</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Liaison Department's Outer Group to explore more cross-college collaboration forms</p>
    <p>Currently, the "Boys' Day" and "Weekly Couple" events are traditional cross-college cooperation projects. Besides these, we can explore more in-depth collaborations and event formats. Currently, the student union does not have activities that involve the entire student body. We can consider elevating the Spring Ball to a student union-level event. Additionally, we can plan large-scale open-day events with specific cultural themes, enriching the orientation activities and conducting them in a "carnival" style for the new student union recruitment.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Career Department</p>
    <p>The Career Department's regular work involves student career planning and guidance, and alumni resources are crucial. Therefore, we can explore collaboration with "JI Connections," utilizing alumni resources to seize opportunities for career planning lectures when alumni visit the campus.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Career Department can attempt to contact more alumni and professors from different disciplines using the platform of Jiao Tong University, and through collaboration with the Executive Committee, organize lectures and interdisciplinary guidance in related fields.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Sports and Culture Department and various student clubs</p>
    <p>The Sports and Culture Department has always played the role of connecting club-based student organizations at JI. However, similar to other departments, there is room for improvement in terms of promotion and event attention. Student clubs have the ability to operate independently, and the Sports and Culture Department can provide support, such as improved promotion and detailed event coverage or joint training.</p>
    <p>Based on this, "JI Imagination" can take responsibility for regular promotion work for student clubs.</p>
