            <p class="lead intro"> Hello everyone! I'm Xu Yifei from the Outer Group of the Liaison Department, Class 6 of the 2022 grade. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> I have always had a strong interest and passion for student affairs. From elementary school until now, I’ve always had positions in my class, actively helping teachers and classmates and enjoying it. Through continuous learning and communication, I gradually realized that passion alone is not the answer to solving problems; paying attention to details is equally important. After entering JI, I took on the role of the organizational committee member in Class 6. I have been involved in the planning and organization of activities by the Outer Group, responsible for procurement, communication, and coordination of materials for the "Boys' Day" event, as well as leading team members in the "One-week Couple" activity. Through these experiences, I have grown, improved myself, and gradually developed the ability to stand out in certain situations. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> "Together," "seriously," and "fun" are the three words that form the foundation of my campaign. In any organization, teamwork and team consciousness always play an irreplaceable role. We need to work together and move forward hand in hand. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> "Serious" and "fun" may sound contradictory, but in fact, they represent a balance. "Fun" represents joy, and the student union is a place that should bring happiness. By approaching work with a "fun" mentality and embracing challenges with a positive attitude, we can create a pleasant atmosphere. However, a relaxed mindset should be accompanied by careful work. Being responsible and well-prepared can lead to better activities, making everyone happier! </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> Passion is not the answer to solving problems, but it is an efficient catalyst. I firmly believe that in the process of continuous reform and progress, JISU can carry your passion and become a bridge for spreading happiness! </p>

            <p class="lead intro">大家好！我是联络部外联组的徐逸飞，来自2022级6班。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 我一直以来对学生工作都有着较为浓厚的兴趣和热情。从小学至今我一直都在班级里担任一些职务，积极帮助老师和同学们，乐在其中。通过不断地学习和交流，我逐渐发现，热爱不是解决问题的答案，很多的细节都需要格外地注意。进入密院后，我担任6班的组织委员，多次参与外联组活动的策划和组织，“男生节”活动中负责物资的采购以及沟通和协调工作，“一周cp”活动中带领组员进行活动。我在一次次的经历中获得了成长，提升自己，也慢慢地可以在某些时候拥有独挡一面的能力。</p>
            <p class="lead intro"> “一起”、“认真”、“玩”，两个副词和一个动词的搭配，构成了我的竞选理念。在任何一项组织中，团队精神和团队意识永远有着不可磨灭的角色。我们需要一同努力，携手前行。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> “认真”和“玩”听着有些矛盾，但实际上可以看作两者之间的平衡。“玩”代表着快乐，学生会是一个能带来快乐的地方，用“玩”的心态来应对工作，以积极的情绪来拥抱挑战。然而，心态放松，做事需要谨慎。认真负责充足的准备，才能带来更高的活动，让大家玩的更开心！ </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 热爱不是解决问题的答案，但热爱是一个高效的催化剂。我坚信，在不断的改革和进步中，学生会一定能承载你的热爱，成为传播快乐的桥梁！ </p>

    <h2>Campaign Philosophy: Enjoy the work together~</h2>
    <h2>Campaign Platform: Pursue Media-driven Development, Create a New Model that Combines Team, Work, and Play.</h2>

    <h2>Platform Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, some members of the student onion are under excessive work pressure, while others rarely participate in student union activities. Initially, we joined the student union because of our passion, but gradually, the sense of enjoyment seems to be diminishing. The reason for this may be inadequate team building. Therefore, I aim to integrate teamwork, work, and play as the overall reform goals.
    </p>

    <h3>I. About Deepening the Construction and Reform of the Student Union Organization</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Positioning of the Student union</p>
            <p>
                In summary, the student union is a platform established by students, serving students, following school leadership, and safeguarding student rights. Essentially, the student union is like a "bridge" that connects students with teachers and with each other. Therefore, the student union is a service-oriented organization whose main business is to serve students.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reform direction of a service-oriented organization can be considered from two aspects: enhancing publicity effectiveness and improving service quality. Therefore, the reform of the media department will be one of the key aspects of my reform plan. In the era of social media, publicity is a crucial task for any organization, especially for a service-oriented organization like the student union. However, the current publicity work needs improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering the importance of the media department, I hope to drive the overall reform of the student union by reforming the media department, thereby enhancing work efficiency and the role of the student union.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reform Plan for a New Media Model: Comprehensive Reform of the Media Department</p>
            <p>
                To align with the positioning of the student union, the media department needs certain functional adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the media department consists of the design group, subscription group, and photography group. It appears that the relative emptiness of content is a common problem in the media department. Based on this, I propose the following reform plan:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Revision of the functions of the Subscription group</p>
                    <p>
                        I suggest clarifying the mode of cooperation for WeChat Account subscription: other departments independently complete content writing and basic formatting, and then submit it to the subscription group for secondary formatting. The purpose of secondary formatting is to give different sections different promotional styles, including color schemes, fonts, and layout patterns, through collaboration within the media department.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, during periods when subscriptions are not active, the group can engage in in-depth formatting design learning and create a library of templates and resources for other departments to use.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Expansion of the functions of the photography group</p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the photography group can write their own reports as event photographers, complementing the official summaries of other departments. The style of their work will focus on capturing highlights, on-the-spot moments, voting games, interactive challenges, and interviews. The goal is to pay attention to feedback from event participants and establish a two-way feedback channel. (Further discussion on the rights and interests aspect)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the photography group can start creating "JI Album," a long-term project that includes high-quality images, such as large-scale photos of the campus. This project can incorporate diverse forms, such as photography submissions. In the new year, we can organize artistic photography sessions with a limited number of participants for specific types of photo shoots and editing work.

                    <p>Transformation of the design group into the graphic design group</p>
                    <p>
                        The original functions of the "design group" will be taken over and retained.
                        In addition, it will primarily be responsible for the continuous production of "JI Imagination" and related graphic design work. (Further discussion on the Institute's culture aspect)

            <p>Reform of the Student union's Organizational Structure: Working Groups (Liaison Department's Outer Group as a Pilot)</p>
            <p>
                Reform Goal: A new model that combines teamwork, work, and play. Currently, some students face excessive work pressure, which may be due to inadequate team building, leading to a lack of enjoyment. Therefore, I aim to integrate teamwork, work, and play as the overall reform goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, most activities are organized by voluntary participation, resulting in uneven distribution of workload and some students not contributing. I propose the implementation of working groups, with the group as the smallest unit of structure. Activity planning will be carried out by designated working groups, replacing voluntary participation. This approach will facilitate closer communication within the group, driving overall interaction and communication within the department.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address the issue of lack of motivation among students, efforts will be made to include student union activities in the school's labor hour system.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Technical Department: Enhancing Activity Promotion Effects</p>
            <p>
                The activities of the technical department have their unique characteristics. I acknowledge the current philosophy of organizing activities: "Let all participants leave with gains." However, the problem is that some students are not even aware of the activities organized by the technical department. Therefore, I believe there should be an emphasis on enhancing promotional efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
                One possible obstacle is that the content may seem dull. Therefore, images or simple edited videos can be included in the promotions to make the technical achievements more visually appealing. Additionally, the use of past event reviews in the form of videos can attract the audience's attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the technical department can explore other types of technical work beyond programming, such as assembly and construction techniques taught in the engineering course.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Other Departments</p>
            <p>
                As a pilot department for "interactive media," further discussion is needed for the Art Department. The Inner Group of the Liaison Department will be discussed in the "rights and interests" section. The Career Department, Outer Group of the Liaison Department, and Sport and Club Department will be discussed in the section on "communication between the student union and school-level and college-level student organizations."
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>II. College Culture and Activities</h2>
    <h3>1. Ji Album</h3>
  <p>The Ji Album is a long-term project that aims to capture the essence and spirit of the college through high-quality images. It will include large-scale photos of the campus, photography submissions, and artistic photography sessions. The project will create a library of visual resources that showcase the beauty and vibrancy of our college community.</p>
    <h3>2. "JI Imagination" Production</h3>
<p>The editing work for "JI Imagination" has already begun at the beginning of the service month, and the first issue has been released. In terms of content, it focuses more on the college scope and students themselves. "JI Imagination" currently consists of four content sections: "Reflection," "Snapshot," "Roaming," and "Bubbles." We aim to provide retrospectives and summaries of activities from a real and firsthand perspective. Additionally, we are committed to collecting beautiful moments from students' lives at JI. Among them, the "Roaming" section mainly includes literary works created by students, which can be compiled and reviewed as a special edition of "JI Imagination" once accumulated. The current structure and operation of "JI Imagination" allow for broad content coverage and ample room for future development.</p>

<h2>III. Safeguarding Student Rights and Feedback</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rights Work Monthly Report (Corresponding to the Liaison Department's Inner Group)</p>
    <p>The nature of traditional rights work is relatively unique. The inner group of the student union serves as a bridge, responsible for conveying students' needs to teachers and school leaders, and to some extent, supervising the execution by teachers and leaders. In this relationship, students are the clients we serve.</p>
    <p>The work goal is not to solve one or a few specific problems but to ensure the existence of a channel for problem resolution. Relying solely on "meetings with the dean" is not enough; therefore, regular feedback to students, in the form of a rights work monthly report or multi-party meetings, is necessary.</p>
    <p>Additionally, students' understanding of the resources provided by the school is also an important aspect of rights work. Therefore, during the service month, an activity called "Resource Organization" was conducted, where I was responsible for organizing the methods of accessing files in the Jiao Tong Library and organizing resources at the Student Innovation Center.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the student union's own rights work: "Interactive Media" (to be piloted in some major events)</p>
    <p>The "interactive media" approach aims to achieve two-way feedback. The classic example of this existing mechanism is the President's Mailbox, where students can directly provide feedback to the school president. This model can be used to assess the quality of student union activities, as feedback from participants is the best way to evaluate them. High-quality event participants can provide direct feedback, for example, many students share posts about the Spring Dance on social media. However, achieving in-depth and extensive "interactive" feedback requires official planning and implementation.</p>
    <p>Based on this, I propose two approaches:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The photography group of the media department can conduct on-site coverage, voting games, interactive challenges, interviews, and other forms to directly obtain feedback from event participants and capture authentic moments of the event.</li>
      <li>Incorporate more video elements into promotions.</li>
      <li>Modify the format of ministerial meetings and invite selected members and event participants as guest speakers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>IV. Communication Between the Student union and School-Level/College-Level Student Organizations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Liaison Department's Outer Group to explore more cross-college collaboration forms</p>
    <p>Currently, the "Boys' Day" and "Weekly Couple" events are traditional cross-college cooperation projects. Besides these, we can explore more in-depth collaborations and event formats. Currently, the student union does not have activities that involve the entire student body. We can consider elevating the Spring Ball to a student union-level event. Additionally, we can plan large-scale open-day events with specific cultural themes, enriching the orientation activities and conducting them in a "carnival" style for the new student union recruitment.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Career Department</p>
    <p>The Career Department's regular work involves student career planning and guidance, and alumni resources are crucial. Therefore, we can explore collaboration with "JI Connections," utilizing alumni resources to seize opportunities for career planning lectures when alumni visit the campus.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the Career Department can attempt to contact more alumni and professors from different disciplines using the platform of Jiao Tong University, and through collaboration with the Executive Committee, organize lectures and interdisciplinary guidance in related fields.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Sports and Culture Department and various student clubs</p>
    <p>The Sports and Culture Department has always played the role of connecting club-based student organizations at JI. However, similar to other departments, there is room for improvement in terms of promotion and event attention. Student clubs have the ability to operate independently, and the Sports and Culture Department can provide support, such as improved promotion and detailed event coverage or joint training.</p>
    <p>Based on this, "JI Imagination" can take responsibility for regular promotion work for student clubs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <h2>竞选理念：一起来认真的玩~</h2>
    <h2>竞选纲领：传媒带动发展，打造团队、工作和玩乐相结合的新模式。</h2>

    <h2>纲领解释：</h2>
    <p>
        目前部分部员的工作压力太大，又有部分部员极少参与学生会活动。大家最初因为热爱来到学生会，而渐渐地，乐趣值似乎不可避免地在降低，其原因可能是团队建设不够完善，因此感受不到乐趣，所以我将以团队、工作、玩乐三者结合为总改革目标。
    </p>

    <h3>I. 学生会组织建设及改革方案深化</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>学生会的定位</p>
            <p>
                概括上说，学生会是一个学生自主成立，服务于学生，听从学校领导，维护学生权益的平台。本质上，学生会像是一座“桥梁”，连接了学生和老师，也连接了学生彼此。因此，学生会是一个以服务学生为主业的服务性组织。
            </p>
            <p>
                服务性组织的改革方向可以从两个方面考虑：如何增强宣传效果，如何提高服务质量。因此，传媒部相关的内容会是我改革方案的重点之一。在如今的社交媒体时代，宣传是任何一项机构都需要认真对待的工作，对于服务性组织更是如此，因此，传媒部的改革问题会牵扯到整个学生会，可是现今的宣传工作有待提高。
            </p>
            <p>
                鉴于传媒的重要地位，我希望以传媒部的改革来带动学生会的整体改革，提升工作效率以及学生会的作用。
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>传媒新模式改革方案：传媒部综合改革</p>
            <p>
                为了契合学生会的定位，传媒部需要做一定的职能调整。
            </p>
            <p>
                目前的传媒部由周边设计组、推送制作组和摄影组组成。目前看来，内容的相对空洞性是传媒部目前的常见的问题。基于此，我尝试提出如下改革方案:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>推送制作组职能修订</p>
                    <p>
                        我建议对推送制作合作的方式进行明确规定：由其他部门自主完成内容的撰写和简易排版；随后递交给传媒部推送制作组进行二次排版。二次排版的目的是在传媒部的协作下赋予不同部分不同的推送风格，包括：颜色风格，字体，排版模式等。
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        此外，在非推送制作期间，推送制作组可进行深度排版设计学习，并制作各部门推送排版库和素材库，以便提供丰富的模板给其他部门使用。
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>摄影组职能开拓</p>
                    <p>
                        除此之外，摄影组可撰写自己作为活动摄影方的推送报导，和其他部门们的官方总结推送构成互补，其风格以花絮、现场直击、投票游戏、互动挑战、采访元素为主。目的在于关注活动参与者的反馈，建立双向反馈通道。（权益部分后议）
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        此外，摄影组开始制作“密院相册”，长期制作例如lbl高清大图等一系列图集，可以融合摄影征稿等多元形式。在新一年可开展艺术照拍摄活动，限定人数进行特定种类的照片拍摄和修图工作。
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>周边设计组改为平面设计组</p>
                    <p>
                        原“周边设计组”的职能承接并保留。此外，主要负责于“觅念集”的持续制作，以及于此相关的平面设计工作。（学院文化部分详议）
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>学生会组织形式改革：工作小组（联络部外联组作为试点）</p>
            <p>
                改革目标：团队、工作和玩乐三者相结合的新模式。目前部分同学的工作压力太大，其原因可能是团队建设不够完善，因此感受不到乐趣，所以我将以团队、工作、玩乐三者结合为总改革目标。
            </p>
            <p>
                目前大多活动的组织是由学生志愿参加，这样会造成工作量分配不平均，有些同学没有贡献。我尝试提出工作小组制，以小组为最小的结构单位，活动的筹划由指定数量的小组完成，以组织性替代志愿性。这样组内同学之间的交流会更加密切，带动部门整体的互动交流。
            </p>
            <p>
                针对同学间缺少动力的问题，尽力争取学生会活动纳入劳动学时。
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>技术部：增强活动宣传效果</p>
            <p>
                技术部的活动具有其特殊性，我认可现行的办活动理念：“让所有的参与者都带着收获离开”。可是问题是，有部分学生根本没有了解到技术部的活动，我认为应加强宣传效果层面加强。
            </p>
            <p>
                内容较为枯燥可能是阻碍之一，因此在推送中可用图片或是简易剪辑的视频形式附上效果，讲技术成果更为直观化，也可通过历次活动现场回顾的形式吸引受众。
            </p>
            <p>
                此外，技术部可尝试开拓除了编程技术以外的其他类型技术工作，例如工程导论中的一些组装拼接技术等。
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>其他部门</p>
            <p>
                文艺部作为“互动式传媒”的试点部门，后详议；联络部内联组将在“权益”部分讨论；事业部、联络部外联组、社体部将在“学生会与校级院级学生组织的交流”部分讨论。
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>II. 学院文化与活动</h2>
    <h3>1. 密院相册</h3>
        <p>传媒部摄影组负责制作和编写，已在“学生会组织建设与改革方案深化”中介绍，未来可作为“觅念集”特辑增刊。</p>
    <h3>2. “觅念集”制作</h3>
        <p>“觅念集”编辑工作已经于服务月初启程，目前已发行第一期。内容层面，更多关注于学院范围以及学生本身。“觅念集”目前的四个内容板块：“回眸”、“掠影”、“漫游”、“泡沫墙”。我们希望从真实和亲身体验的角度带来活动的回顾和总结，此外，也致力于收藏密院学生生活中的美好瞬间。其中，“漫游”部分以同学自主创作的文学作品为主，等到积累之后可作为“觅念集”特辑增刊整体回顾。“觅念集”目前的结构和运营如此，纸质刊物可做到海纳百川，未来有着充分的发展空间。</p>

<h2>III. 学生权益维护与意见反馈</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>权益工作月报（对应联络部内联组）</p>
    <p>传统权益工作的性质比较特殊。学生会联络部内联组只是桥梁作用，负责将学生的需求反馈给老师和领导们，此外也一定程度上需要监督老师和领导们的执行。这层关系下，学生是我们服务的客户。</p>
    <p>工作目标不是解决某一项或者某几项问题，而是保证一直存在一个解决问题的途径，仅靠“院长见面会”是不够的，因此需要定期将工作情况向学生客户反馈，可采用权益工作月报的形式或者多方例会的形式。</p>
    <p>此外，学生对于校方提供资源的掌握程度也应是权益工作的内容之一，因此在服务月期间进行了“资源整理”的活动，我负责了交大图书馆文件查询方式以及学生创新中心资源整理。</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>针对学生会自身的权益工作：“互动式”传媒（可现在一些大型活动试点）</p>
    <p>“互动式”传媒力争于达成双向反馈。校长信箱是现存双向反馈机制的经典案例，校长是学校的领导者，学生们也可直接向校长提意见。这样的模式可以用来自我检查学生会活动的质量，活动参与者的反馈是最好的检查方式。高质量的活动参与者们会直接自主反馈，例如很多同学都会发春季舞会的朋友圈，但深度广泛的“互动式”反馈需要通过官方层面的策划。</p>
    <p>基于此，我尝试提出两种方式：</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>由传媒部摄影组展开活动的现场直击、投票游戏、互动挑战、采访元素等形式，目的在于直接获得活动参与者的反馈，以及更为真实的活动现场记录。</li>
      <li>多融入视频元素进行宣传。</li>
      <li>部长例会形式修改，邀请部分部员和活动参与者作为特邀嘉宾参与部长例会。</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>IV. 学生会与校级院级学生组织的交流</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>联络部外联组联谊组探索更多跨院合作形式</p>
    <p>目前的“男生节”、“一周cp”是传统的外联跨院合作项目，除此之外可探索一些更深层次的合作和活动形式。目前学生会并没有全体性质的活动，可尝试将春季舞会升为学生会级活动，此外可类似尝试筹划特定文化主题的学生会开放日大型活动，例如可丰富迎新活动形式，用“嘉年华”的形式展开新一届的学生会招新。</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>事业部</p>
    <p>事业部的常规工作是学生生涯规划和事业辅导，其中校友资源是非常重要的资源，因此可在此基础上，探索和“密缘人”的合作方式，利用“密缘人”的校友资源，抓住校友返校的契机进行职业规划宣讲等活动。</p>
    <p>此外，事业部可尝试利用交大平台联系更多不同专业的校友和教授，利用主席团联系其他学院，不同专业的教授开展相关领域的讲座和跨领域指导。</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>社体部和各社团性学生组织</p>
    <p>社体部一直承担着连接密院的社团性学生组织的职能，然而同样是目前宣传工作做得不够好，赛事的关注度不够。各社团性学生组织有着自主运营的能力，社体部尽量尝试给它们提供一些帮助，例如宣传工作以及更为精致的赛场记录，或是联院训练的内容。</p>
    <p>在此基础上，可尝试利用“觅念集”来负责社团性学生组织的定期宣传工作。</p>
  </li>
</ol>
