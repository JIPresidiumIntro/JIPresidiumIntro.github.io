            <h1 id="-"> Bai Han </h1>
            <p class="lead intro"> "With the heart of a fierce tiger and the ability to appreciate the delicate scent of a rose, I possess both a passionate drive and a keen eye for detail. In areas such as rights advocacy, cultural initiatives, and events, I bring my unique ideas to the table. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> In just two semesters, I have been involved in various student organizations, including the Student Council, Youth Volunteer Team, Interview Group, Science Association, and the Buddy Program. Throughout these experiences, I have continuously explored and sought the flickering light within my heart. Becoming an innovator of activities, an advocate for student rights, and a contributor to student organizations have become the driving forces behind my passion. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> When it comes to activity innovation, I excel at finding entry points and focusing on the unique characteristics of our college, such as internationalization. Within the college community, I strive to facilitate vibrant events that promote cross-cultural communication and foster a more inclusive and diverse environment. I actively communicate and seek collaborations, leveraging relevant resources to transform ideas into reality.</p>
            <p class="lead intro"> Regarding student rights, I am attentive to the needs expressed by individuals around me. I also pay close attention to areas where improvements can be made in my own academic and personal life. I am committed to narrowing the "information gap" and establishing more timely and convenient channels for expressing opinions and receiving feedback. </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> Furthermore, I prioritize the long-term development of the Student Council, aiming to enhance its cohesion and influence. I actively contribute ideas for interdepartmental cooperation, fostering communication, coordination, and mutual growth among departments. My goal is to propel the JI Student Council to stand out among the various student organizations in our college, building upon its current foundation and establishing a distinctive identity.</p>

            <p class="lead intro">“心有猛虎，细嗅蔷薇。”我既拥有饱满的热情与大胆的想法，也能够在细心观察中“独具慧眼“，在权益、文化、活动等方面都富有自己独特的idea。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 短短两个学期中，我参与了学生会、青志队、访谈组、科协以及Buddy Program，在尝试的过程中不断探索，不断寻觅心中的微光。做一名活动的创新者、学生权益的发声者、学生组织的贡献者，这些想法逐渐成为了我的热情所在。</p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 在活动创新方面，我善于寻找切入点，聚焦学院独有的特色，如internationalization等，在学院内部力争通过更为精彩的活动促进来自不同文化背景的人们相互交流，塑造更为包容多元的环境。并且我积极沟通，主动寻找合作，能够有效借助相关资源，将想法更好地变为现实。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 学生权益上，我是一名生活中的有心人，经常会留意身边听到的诉求，也留意自己在学习、生活中需要改进的地方，并且我也致力于缩小“信息差“，建设更及时方便的意见提出、反馈途径。 </p>
            <p class="lead intro"> 此外，我也注重学生会的长远发展，提升学生会的凝聚力和号召力。积极为跨部门合作提出想法，促进部门之间的沟通协调与共同发展。我希望能够推动密院学生会，使其在现在的基础上更有特色，在众多学院的学生组织中脱颖而出。 </p>

            <h1 id="PolicyAgenda"><strong>Policy Agenda</strong></h1>
            <style>
            </style>

            <h2 id="-"> Campaign Philosophy: Aim for the stars, start with little sparks. </h2>
            <p class="lead intro"> In the future work of the Student Council's executive team, I will focus on two key concepts: personal value and interconnectivity. </p>

            <h2 id="-"> 1.Personal Value </h2>
            <p> Transform the Student Council into a place where students' personal value can be fully realized. Enable students involved in the Student Council to feel and recognize their ability to make a difference in college development and student activities. </p>
            <p> Due to the large number of Student Council members, it is impractical for most students to be familiar with each other. My goal is to create a sense of "spontaneity" among Student Council volunteers, making them feel that the activities in the Student Council are enjoyable and meaningful. They can realize their own value by contributing to the college or the students' learning and lives. By actively engaging with the Student Council, despite the workload, they willingly form a cohesive bond. </p>
            <p> I will focus on activities, rights, and structure to explain how the Student Council can become a place for individuals to realize their value. </p>

            <h2> Activities </h2>
            <h3> 1.1 Attraction </h3>
            <p> To make an activity appealing, where many students are willing to participate, even students from other colleges are attracted to it. I believe that being part of the Student Council will bring a sense of pride and belonging, instilling a sense of honor and affiliation with the collective. </p>
            <p> How can activities become more attractive? Firstly, think outside the box and organize events that others have not thought of. Secondly, organize events that others have thought of, but do it better. Novelty is a common aspect, but attention to detail is crucial for the success of an event. Besides the theme and content, the key to a successful event lies in the details. As event planners, we need to consider the details that make each participant feel valued and enhance their experience. A positive experience leads to positive word-of-mouth, which is crucial for the long-term success and influence of an event. </p>

            <h3> 1.2 Meaningfulness </h3>
            <p> I will strive to enable participants in Student Council activities to earn "co-curricular credits." A specific person in the executive team will be responsible for facilitating the application of co-curricular credits. Although this approach may seem utilitarian, it aligns with the mandatory requirements for students to complete co-curricular credits for graduation. Additionally, many students face intense competition for these credits. Therefore, the Student Council can provide more students with opportunities to obtain these credits. </p>
            <p> By aligning with the standards and requirements of co-curricular credits, we can make Student Council activities more meaningful and facilitate the personal growth of participants. Hence, I plan to adjust activities in certain departments: </p>
            <p> Career Department: Offer career-related lectures and workshops for freshmen and sophomores, providing assistance in student career planning and helping them gain clarity about their future paths. </p>
            <p> Outer-Liaison Group: Organize a "Count-down Party" during the start of each academic year, bringing together new domestic and international students and fostering stronger connections between them. </p>

            <h2> Rights </h2>
            <p> The internal Student Rights Committee (SRC) is a convenient platform for collecting rights-related feedback. However, its low visibility is a result of insufficient promotion. It is not enough to simply inform students about the existence of this platform. We must ensure that the feedback provided receives sincere responses and is not ignored, to build trust among students in this avenue for rights feedback. </p>
            <p> Hence, the promotion of rights feedback is crucial. I propose regularly announcing the collected rights feedback on the Canvas platform, ensuring that all students take notice, including international students, with a link to the SRC website. This approach guarantees that students' demands receive replies and enables the volunteers responsible for handling rights-related matters to feel the value of their tasks. </p>
            <p> Furthermore, we can expand the scope of "rights" by encouraging students to provide suggestions and ideas on the SRC platform regarding the Cultural Products Shop and its creative endeavors. </p>

            <h2> Structure </h2>
            <p> One key issue currently faced is the excessive number of volunteers in departments. Most department heads have expressed difficulties in involving all volunteers in activities. It is challenging to determine the enthusiasm of students solely through one round of interviews, and many freshmen and sophomores may initially overcommit to multiple organizations, only to realize later that they cannot handle the workload. </p>
            <p> To address this, retiring department heads will limit the number of new volunteers based on their experiences throughout the year. However, an additional pathway for joining the Student Council will remain. During the fall semester activities, one or two slots will be open to non-Student Council students who have expressed interest and demonstrated capabilities in organizing events. Exceptional individuals can be accepted into the Student Council before the start of the spring semester, with clear expectations and responsibilities communicated by department heads. This voluntary selection process allows students to make a conscious decision based on their availability. </p>

            <h2 id="-"> 2.Interconnectivity </h2>
            <p> The purpose of interconnectivity is to broaden perspectives. In addition to personal value realization, it allows us to see more, see further, and stand taller, promoting innovative ideas. </p>

            <h3> 2.1 Communication between the Student Council President and Department Heads </h3>
            <p> Promote mutual understanding among department heads regarding each department's work. The executive team will regularly collect and consolidate activity plans from all departments, along with any issues and solutions for future reference. This fosters a culture of learning and sharing among department heads, allowing future leaders to build upon the successes of their predecessors. </p>

            <h3> 2.2 Communication between International and Domestic Students </h3>
            <p> JI is an internationally-oriented institution characterized by its openness and inclusion of diverse cultures. It is essential for JI students to overcome biases and bridge the gap between international and domestic students. </p>

            <p> Due to course and dormitory constraints, interactions largely rely on activities. Bilingual communication, specifically targeting international students, and becoming acquainted with leaders of the International Student Association (ISA), are three crucial elements. </p>

            <h3> 2.3 Connection between JI and students who have studied abroad </h3>
            <p> Juniors and seniors who have studied abroad can share valuable insights and experiences from overseas universities. We hope to incorporate these insights into JI's teaching and activities to continuously improve. We encourage these students to actively participate, not just as observers, but as contributors. Therefore, we plan to invite former Student Council presidents or department heads to return to JI and engage in exchanges with current Student Council members. </p>

            <h2 id="-"> 竞选理念：Aim for the stars, start with little sparks. </h2>
            <p> 在未来学生会主席团成员的工作中，我将围绕两个关键词：个人价值、互联互通。 </p>
            <h2 id="-"> 一、个人价值 </h2>
            <p> 将学生会变成学生的个人价值最能得以充分实现的地方，让在学生会工作的学生们感受和意识到自己能够通过学生会在学院建设或是学生活动等方面 make a difference。 </p>
            <p> 由于学生会人数众多，因此要求大部分同学相互熟悉是不现实的，我希望做到的，是像磁铁一样让学生会志愿者们拥有“自发性”，觉得学生会的活动很好玩，在里面工作很有意义，能够有自我价值的实现，“我在学生会里工作，能够给学院，或是给学生们的学习额可与生活带来改变。”主动地靠近学生会，虽然有workload但是愿意在其中工作，自发的形成一种凝聚力。 </p>
            <p> 我将在活动、权益、架构三个方面阐释如何让学生会成为一个实现自我价值的地方。 </p>
            <h2> 1.活动  </h2>
            <h3> 1.1吸引力 </h3>
            <p> 如果一个活动吸引力强，很多同学愿意来参加，甚至其它学院的同学也能慕名而来，我相信身为学生会中的一份子，一定会有一种骄傲和自豪，从而对这个集体产生荣誉感和归属感。 </p>
            <p> 如何让活动变得更有吸引力？一是会“整活”，办别人没有想到的，二是别人想得到，但是我们比别人办得好。 </p>
            <p> novelty是大部分人都会想到的点，但是“细节决定成败”，一个活动举办得成功与否的关键，除了主题内容之外，细节是影响参与者对活动印象的一大关键。作为活动的策划者，需要在细节上充分考虑，让每个参与者觉得自己被重视，体验感upup。良好的体验感带来良好的口碑，这是对一个活动长期举办，并能越来越有影响力是至关重要的。 </p>
            <h3> 1.2有意义 </h3>
            <p> 我将会争取在学生会的活动中，让参与者获得“第二课堂”学时，主席团中专门有人负责“第二课堂”学时的申请有关工作。虽然比较功利，但鉴于这是现在同学们毕业要完成的硬性指标，而且很多学时的名额竞争比较激烈，学生会将来能够让更多的同学拥有得到学时的机会。 </p>
            <p> 借助“第二课堂”的标准和要求，将学生会的活动变得更有意义，让参与的同学获得成长。因此，计划调整一些部门的活动。 </p>
            <p> 事业部，career企业招聘宣讲等，提供对学生生涯规划方面的帮助，距离大一大二同学太遥远，参与少。未来建议利用校友资源，举办一些适合大一大二学生的讲座和活动，从在某个行业从业者的角度，让学生们了解如果未来像向这个行业发展的话需要哪些方面的知识，需要在课堂之外培养哪些能力，更加清晰地去认识自己适不适合这个行业，去了解工科出身的话在这个行业会有哪些劣势，又该怎么去弥补等等。让低年级的同学们对未来不再那么迷茫。并且也可以请一些教授来分享学界信息，分享自己科研的经历等等。 </p>
            <p> 外联部：目前外联部没有固定活动。我计划在每年开学，面向国内和国际的新生举办分组做任务打卡积分活动，采用外联部原本一周cp的活动形式，但是活动的目的不再是最原始的带有相亲性质，也不限于今年改成的友情向，而是类似于一个Buddy2.0版本，每个组中有几名中国学生和一名国际生。因为是外联，希望能够带动交大其它学院促进中国和留学生的关系。 </p>
            <p> 传媒部：因为传媒的制作时需要门槛的，座椅传媒部现在苦于活动的受众不是很广这个问题。我建议传媒部增加“街头采访”，“短视频”制作等活动，一方面采访主持人和短视频参演人员不需要专业门槛，可以让更多人参与，另一方面街头采访等活动对学生会来说比较新颖，能够贴近同学们的日常生活，受到欢迎，易于增加JISU的影响力。 </p>
            <h2> 2.权益 </h2>
            <p> 内联的SRC在我认为其实是一个比较方便的日常随时随地搜集权益的方式，但是它知名度非常低，确实是宣传没到位的问题，但如果只是单一地告诉大家有这个平台是不够的，只有让大家看到提出的问题都能够得到真诚的反馈之后，不会石沉大海，才能让更多的同学信任这个权益反馈途径，愿意去在这个平台上组织语言，把问题发布出来。 </p>
            <p> 因此，权益反馈的宣传程度是很重要的。我希望能够定期在Canvas的Undergraduates中，将这段时间内收集的权益反馈给公告出来，这样所有同学都一定能注意到，包括国际生在内，在其后附上SRC的网址。不仅能让全体同学的诉求得到回复，也能够让负责相关权益的志愿者感受到自己的任务很有价值。 </p>
            <p> 并且，可以拓宽“权益”的范畴，密院小铺的文创产品，大家也可以在SRC上提出建议和想法，能够给小铺的同学灵感和创意。 </p>
            <h2> 3.架构 </h2>
            <p> 架构目前集中在部门志愿者人数的问题方面。 </p>
            <p> 大部分部长反馈志愿者人数过多，不能让每个志愿者都参与到活动当中，因为不太能够凭借一次招新面试判断出同学是否能在后续的工作中保持热情，而且对大一新生，密院的workload是没有概念的，可能会报很多个组织，后来逐渐发现是将不够用的情况。 </p>
            <p> 将要退休的部长根据这一年中的经验限定招新的人数，但是还预留有另一个进入学生会的途径。在秋季学期的活动当中，开放一两个名额给非学生会的同学，有想法的同学也可以参与活动的组织，如果有同学表现优秀的，可以在春季学期开始前同意加入学生会。 </p>
            <p> 在春季学期开始前，每个部门中原有的志愿者，可以自愿选择愿不愿意在继续在学生会中工作，部长需要告知清楚，如果继续留在学生会在之后需要完成的任务。这是处于学生对自己的时间是否能handle的自愿选择。 </p>

            <h2 id="-"> 二、互通互联 </h2>
            <p> 互通互联的目的是打开视野，在自我价值实现的基础上，看的更多，看的更远，站得更高，促进创新的想法。 </p>

            <h3> 1.学生会主席和部长们的联系 </h3>
            <p> 部长之间相互了解其它部门的工作，主席团定期收集整理各部门的活动策划，这次活动中出现的问题和希望后面一届举办的时候采取的解决方案。能够让部长们相互学习借鉴。后面的部长也能够站在前人的肩膀上。 </p>
            <h3> 2.国际生和国内学生的联系 </h3>
            <p> JI 是一个以internationalization为特点的国际化学院，希望能彰显JI对不同文化的包容开放，能够拥有diversity。了解不同文化是很有意思的事，也是年轻人认识世界很关键的东西，希望密院学生能消除偏见，打破国籍的隔阂。 </p>
            <p> 课程、寝室等原因，只能依靠活动促进相互交流。中英文双语推送，特意转发到国际生的群里，和ISA的领导者熟悉起来，是三个关键要素。 </p>
            <h3> 3.参加各种项目在国外的学长学姐和在密院同学的联系 </h3>
            <p> 在国外学习的学长学姐在看到了解海外高校的一些教学方式或是活动组织中，有比较好的地方，希望能够传授回密院，让密院的教学和活动不断吸取长处，变得更好。 </p>
            <p> 希望他们能够实打实地参与进来，而不是来个过场。所以决定先小范围地、先从学生会中做起，邀请一些曾经的主席或是部长，回到密院和学生会的同学们进行交流。 </p>
